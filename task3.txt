SELECT title, published_year FROM Books
WHERE published_year > 2000;

-- 4. Get all Fantasy books written by a specific author (e.g., J.K. Rowling)
SELECT b.title, b.genre, a.name
FROM Books b
JOIN Authors a ON b.author_id = a.author_id
WHERE b.genre = 'Fantasy' AND a.name = 'J.K. Rowling';

-- 5. Find all members whose name starts with 'A'
SELECT * FROM Members
WHERE name LIKE 'A%';

-- 6. Find members who joined between 2020-01-01 and 2024-01-01
SELECT name, join_date FROM Members
WHERE join_date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2024-01-01';

-- 7. Get a list of issued books that have not been returned
SELECT ib.issue_id, b.title, m.name AS member_name
FROM IssuedBooks ib
JOIN Books b ON ib.book_id = b.book_id
JOIN Members m ON ib.member_id = m.member_id
WHERE ib.return_date IS NULL;

-- 8. Order books by number of available copies (descending)
SELECT title, copies_available FROM Books
ORDER BY copies_available DESC;

-- 9. List the 5 most recently issued books
SELECT ib.issue_id, b.title, ib.issue_date
FROM IssuedBooks ib
JOIN Books b ON ib.book_id = b.book_id
ORDER BY ib.issue_date DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 10. Get all books where genre is missing (NULL)
SELECT * FROM Books
WHERE genre IS NULL;

-- 11. List all authors who have written more than 1 book
SELECT a.name, COUNT(b.book_id) AS book_count
FROM Authors a
JOIN Books b ON a.author_id = b.author_id
GROUP BY a.author_id
HAVING COUNT(b.book_id) > 1;

-- 12. Find books with titles containing the word 'Harry'
SELECT * FROM Books
