📊 **Task 3: Writing Basic SELECT Queries**
===========================================

🎯 **Objective:**Extract meaningful data from one or more tables using SQL queries.

🛠️ **Tools Used:**

*   DB Browser for SQLite
    
*   MySQL Workbench
    

📂 **Deliverables:**

*   SQL script containing queries using SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and related clauses
    

📘 **Hints / Mini Guide:**Use the following SQL features to complete this task:

1.  **SELECT Statements**
    
    *   Use SELECT \* to fetch all columns
        
    *   Use SELECT column1, column2 to fetch specific columns
        
2.  **WHERE Clause**
    
    *   Filter records using WHERE
        
    *   Combine conditions using AND, OR
        
    *   Use pattern matching with LIKE '%text%'
        
    *   Filter between a range with BETWEEN value1 AND value2
        
3.  **ORDER BY and LIMIT**
    
    *   Use ORDER BY column\_name ASC|DESC to sort results
        
    *   Use LIMIT n to fetch only a certain number of rows
        

🧪 **Example Queries:**

*   sqlCopyEditSELECT \* FROM Books;
    
*   sqlCopyEditSELECT title, published\_year FROM BooksWHERE published\_year > 2000;
    
*   sqlCopyEditSELECT \* FROM MembersWHERE name LIKE 'A%';
    
*   sqlCopyEditSELECT name, join\_date FROM MembersORDER BY join\_date DESCLIMIT 3;
    

📁 **File Structure:**

*   task3\_select\_queries.sql – SQL file with all required queries
    
*   README.txt – this description file
